# Graph-Encoding

> Secure data encryption has been a major challenge since ages and numerous cryptographic algorithms have been designed ever since. The goal of an encryption algorithm is to secure confidential data by preventing unauthorized decryption, for which a *key* is generated. The algorithm *converts plain* text to *ciphertext*. The intended destination/user then uses this cipher to decode it. 
> 
> The proposed algorithm uses graph data structures to generate ciphertext from plain text containing capital and miniscule letters/words, separated by spaces. The idea is to represent the ‘ones’ in binary equivalents of characters as vertices of a graph and then to trace the hamiltonian cycle to generate cipher. Decoding is done in the reverse manner.
